####The Guessing game Part 1! 

Create a program that has a variable answer and allows user to input a number. If the user inputs the correct number it returns "Correct". If the user guesses incorrectly it prints "Incorrect".

Code start: 
```
answer = 6
```

Console Window: 

``` 
Enter a number: 
```

Say you type ```5```. The program prints "Incorrect". 
Say you type ```6```. The program prints "Correct".



Hint: I added Input to the examples of how to use in our summary "ReadMe" file.
