## Summary
#### Logical Operators
**Boolean Logic**<br />
Main Operators are "<", ">", ">=" "<=", "!=", "=="

**Branching** <br/>
All early knowledge of branching truly just refers to "if" statements.

There are really only three things to know about if statements ("if", "elif", and "else").

Example if statement: 
```
if True:
  print("This line is executed")
```

The above code written out means that when the boolean expression for the **if statement equals true** then we execute the code inside the if statement's branch (in this case we print "This line is executed"). 

[](TODO: image to explain branching (flowchart))

```
if False:
  print("This line is executed")
```
And the above code means that we will never hit the ```print("This line is executed")```

**Loops**
while/for - numbers, strings/range - range, skipping, reversal
