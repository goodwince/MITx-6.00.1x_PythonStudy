### Paper Rock Scissors! 

In this exercise, you are going to practice using conditionals (if, elif, else). You will write a small program that will
determine the result of a rock, paper, scissors game, given Player 1 and against the computer. Your program will print
out the result. 

Here are the rules of the game:

Goal: 

```
Choose paper, rock, or scissors: 
```

User enteres "rock".. 

```
Choose paper, rock, or scissors: rock

Computer chose paper. Computers are always better you lose. 
```

For this homework you can tie and it won't retry.


<b>Part 1</b>: Start with a simple program just like our original homework where we had a predetermined value for the computer's guess. Write if statements for each of the possible outcomes. 

<p><b>Part 2</b> Now lets focus on making it random. It was easy before because in Homework 1 we were just using numbers. How can we get randomized paper, rock, or scissors? </p>

<p><b>Hint</b> Define the computer's correct answer in a variable before comparing it to our user's input (similar to previous homework). Then instead of hard-coding it's value use the random number generator to create a random number of 3 possible integers. Then for each integer use an if statement to define our computer's answer.
