#Homework 1 Part 2

In part 1 we created a file that allowed us 1 guess to get a number. Now instead of 1 guess. I want to continually be asked to guess until until I get the answer to the number we generated.

Example: 

```Take a guess 1 through 10.```

The user inputs 7

```Your guess is incorrect.```
```Take a guess 1 through 10.```

User inputs 10

```You are correct. 10 is the correct answer.```
